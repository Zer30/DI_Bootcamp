Explanation of the Code:
playTheGame function:

Starts by asking the user if they want to play using confirm().
If the user chooses not to play, the game ends with a goodbye message.
Prompts the user for a valid number using a while loop to ensure input validation.
Input Validation:

Ensures the user enters a numeric value.
Checks that the number is between 0 and 10. If not, the loop continues until the user provides valid input.
Random Computer Number:

Uses Math.random() and Math.floor() to generate a random integer between 0 and 10.
compareNumbers function:

Takes the user's number and the computer's number as arguments.
Compares the two numbers:
Alerts "WINNER!" if they match.
Alerts hints if the user's number is higher or lower.
Gives the user up to 3 attempts to guess correctly.
Ends the game with a message if the user runs out of attempts.
Bonus:

Ensures continuous input until the user provides a valid number, preventing abrupt termination for invalid inputs.
