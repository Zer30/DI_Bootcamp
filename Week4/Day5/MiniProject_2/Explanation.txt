Explanation of the Code:
Player 1 Input:

Prompts Player 1 to input a word with at least 8 letters.
Validates the input to ensure it meets the length requirement.
Game Setup:

Creates a hiddenWord string filled with * matching the length of the chosen word.
Initializes an array guessedLetters to track guessed letters and an attemptsLeft counter set to 10.
Game Loop:

Continuously prompts Player 2 for a letter until they either guess the word or run out of attempts.
Validates the guess to ensure it’s a single alphabetic character and hasn’t been guessed before.
Guess Processing:

If the guessed letter is in the word:
Updates the hiddenWord to reveal the guessed letter in all correct positions.
Checks if all letters are revealed (win condition).
If the guessed letter is not in the word:
Decreases the attemptsLeft counter and informs Player 2.
Displays the list of all guessed letters after each turn.
End of Game:

If Player 2 reveals all letters, displays a "CONGRATS YOU WIN" message.
If Player 2 runs out of attempts, reveals the correct word and displays "YOU LOSE."
